Personal site at https://droidpl.me

## Build the site

To build this site I used [gitfolio]().

Prepare the dependencies running:
```bash
./bin/bootstrap
```

Build it using this command:
```
./bin/serve
```

If you want to serve it use:
```bash
./bin/build
```

It will serve the site on ``localhost:5000``.
